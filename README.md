# bash_browser_config

The intent of this project is to quickly access links in the testing pipeline that are tested using a limited number of known snapshot branches. They are each assigned a number, so as to not accidentally override a branch currently in test.

Here is how the project begins...

1. Navigate to the terminal.
2. Create the script file (it is a .sh file type)
   - `touch` [file_name.sh]
3. Confirm the file name is correct
   - `ls -a' in the directory of its creation to confirm
4. After validating, add `!/bin/bash`
   - `echo !/bin/bash`
5. Lastly, configure the file permissions.
   - `chmod +x`

Start scripting...
